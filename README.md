# idleminer
An idle game based on Minecraft(*the original idleminer is a discord bot*)

Tutorial:
The most often run command is ```%s```, which sells your inventory. If nothing gets sold, you should re-run the command after a second.

After you get some money, you can start to upgrade your tools: ```%up p 1``` or ```%up s 1```
You can upgrade your pickaxe(p), shovel(s), and axe(a). Sword(w) helps with battles, and Hoe(h) helps with your farm.
